# TheSeeker
A file search tool that aims to overcome some of the limitations of Windows file search that I am not happy with. WinForms application written in C# using dependency injection pattern.
It is still work in progress but already usable.
Named after a song by The Who :)

TODOs:
• Implement a proper handling of directory not found
• Add shortcuts to The Seeker actions to Windows Explorer context menus
