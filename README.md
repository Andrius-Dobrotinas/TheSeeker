# TheSeeker
A file search tool that aims to overcome some of the limitations of Windows file search that I am not happy with. It's a Win-forms application. Named after a song by The Who :)
The application is almost finished, but could use a few features.

TODOs:
• Implement proper handling for directory not found exceptions
• Add shortcuts to The Seeker actions to Windows Explorer context menus
• Add more handy actions for found files
